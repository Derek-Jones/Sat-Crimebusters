The following are the contours of vessel locations:\r\n\r\n![Contours of transmission locations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Derek-Jones/Sat-Crimebusters/master/images/vessel-density-22.png)\r\nHow many transmissions do vessels make per day?  The following shows the number of vessels making a given number of transmissions each day (over one month).  Many vessels make many transmissions per day, while many make very few, with the remaining being somewhere inbetween.\r\n\r\n![Transmissions per day over a month](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Derek-Jones/Sat-Crimebusters/master/images/trans-per-mmsi.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
