{"name":"Satellite Crimebusters","tagline":"Inventorthon hackathon June 2014","body":"# Sea vessel tracking using Satellite AIS data\r\n\r\nThe Satellite Crimebusters team, at the June 2014 Inventorthon, analysed [Automatic Identification System (AIS) data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Identification_System) obtained via [satellite](http://www.exactearth.com/technology/satellite-ais/).\r\nThe event was hosted by the [Satellite Applications Catapult](https://sa.catapult.org.uk/) in Harwell.\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThe data consists of around 250,000 received AIS transmissions per day over 30 days from something like 17,500 distinct vessels.\r\n\r\nOnly vessels over 300 [gross tonnage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_tonnage) are required to transmit AIS information.\r\n\r\nA few vessels appear to be spoofing some fields of the information transmitted, e.g., sending a 4 digit MMSI value when 8 digits are required.\r\n\r\n## Data analysis\r\n\r\n**Where are vessels claiming to be when they transmit?**  The following are the contours of vessel locations:\r\n\r\n![Contours of transmission locations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Derek-Jones/Sat-Crimebusters/master/images/vessel-density-22.png)\r\n\r\n**What routes are vessels taking?** The following are lines connecting all transmissions from the same vessel. Some vessels only switch on AIS when in port, so in these cases lines join start/stop ports.\r\n\r\n![Routes of transmission by each vessel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Derek-Jones/Sat-Crimebusters/master/images/vessel routes (2014-05-19 to 2014-05-22).png)\r\n\r\n**How many transmissions do vessels make per day?**  The following shows the number of vessels making a given number of transmissions each day (over one month).  Many vessels make many transmissions per day, while many make very few, with the remaining being somewhere inbetween.\r\n\r\n![Transmissions per day over a month](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Derek-Jones/Sat-Crimebusters/master/images/trans-per-mmsi.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
