{"name":"Satellite Crimebusters","tagline":"Inventorthon hackathon June 2014","body":"# Sea vessel tracking using Satellite AIS data\r\n\r\nThe Satellite Crimebusters team, at the June 2014 Inventorthon, analysed [Automatic Identification System (AIS) data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Identification_System) obtained via [satellite](http://www.exactearth.com/technology/satellite-ais/).\r\nThe event was hosted by the [Satellite Applications Catapult](https://sa.catapult.org.uk/) in Harwell.\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThe original purpose of AIS was as a collision avoidance system; knowing where nearby vessels are, there direction and speed, making it easier for them to not collide with each other.  An experiment on the International Space Station proved that it was possible to detect these signals from space and satellites were launched to obtaining world wide information on vessels.\r\n\r\nThe data provided for the Inventorthon consists of around 250,000 received AIS transmissions per day over 30 days from something like 17,500 distinct vessels travelling around the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nOnly vessels over 300 [gross tonnage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_tonnage) are required to transmit AIS information.\r\n\r\nA few vessels appear to be spoofing some fields of the information transmitted, e.g., sending a 4 digit MMSI value when 8 digits are required.\r\n\r\nFor today's shipping positions visit [Marine traffic](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/)\r\n\r\n## Data analysis\r\n\r\n**Where are vessels claiming to be when they transmit?**  The following are the contours of vessel locations (imagine a map of the mediterranean supperimposed over these contours):\r\n\r\n![Contours of transmission locations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Derek-Jones/Sat-Crimebusters/master/images/vessel-density-22.png)\r\n\r\nThis density information could be used to locate vessels in locations where they are unlikely to encounter other vessels (useful when transferring goods between vessels).\r\n\r\n**What routes are vessels taking?** The following are lines connecting all transmissions from the same vessel. Some vessels only switch on AIS when in port, so in these cases lines join start/stop ports.\r\n\r\n![Routes of transmission by each vessel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Derek-Jones/Sat-Crimebusters/master/images/vessel routes (2014-05-19 to 2014-05-22).png)\r\n\r\n**How many transmissions do vessels make per day?**   A lot of vessels make many transmissions per day, while some make very few, with the remaining being somewhere in between.\r\n\r\n![Transmissions for 1 day](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Derek-Jones/Sat-Crimebusters/master/images/trans-one-day.png)\r\n\r\nThe following plot gives the same information as above, but for every day of a month, showing that the same daily pattern is repeated.\r\n\r\n![Transmissions per day over a month](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Derek-Jones/Sat-Crimebusters/master/images/trans-per-mmsi.png)\r\n\r\n## Future patterns to search for\r\n\r\nVessels generally travel between land based locations.  Meeting another vessel at sea is an unusual activity.  Flagging vessels which appear to be moving slowly in the same location sounds worthwhile.\r\n\r\nDistance travelled between transmissions.  There is a maximum distance that a vessel can travel between transmissions.  Flagging vessels that travel further than some maximum distance distance sounds worthwhile.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
